# HOPLSA
Higher Order PLSA R package
R package for fitting higher order (i.e.  3D and 4D ) PLSA models. 

This is an R-package in development for fitting PLSA topic models on 2D (matrices), 3D and 4D tensors. It leverages the REigen package and data sparsity to be memory efficient and reasonably fast. Currently only allows for random initializations.
